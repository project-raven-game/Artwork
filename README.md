Here's some concept art. While I was making it, I had the general idea that there were Townies (NPCs that live in the town), occultists (minions), and deities (bosses). The Townies were inspired by Hindu mythology and the enemies were inspired by Russian pagan and Greek mythology.

The shape language is solid but we'll definitely want to revise the enemies to have some sort of nuclear radiation-derived deformities so they're actually spooky.

## Townies

* Raven: Inspired by Dhumavati. Followers wear all black, blacken their teeth, and deprive themselves of pleasure. Symbols are crows, smoke, and ugly things.
* Cat: Inspired by Shashthi and Katyayani. The deity specializes in childbirth so this character could be a healer.
* Dog: Inspired by Bhairava. Deity has a big ego. Symbols are red flowers, drum, noose, trident, skull.
* Owl: Inspired by Lakshmi. Goddess who "leads to one's goal".



## Deities

* Morana/Marzanna/Hecate: Morana is conflated with Hecate so I'm combining them because Hecate has an entire association with the occult and had her own cult.
  * Morana is the goddess of death and she has the power to make visions/hallucinations.
  * In Russian tradition, an effigy of Morana is burned or drowned (sympathetic magic) to celebrate the end of winter and to bring about a good spring. What I'm thinking for the story is that she *isn't* an inherently evil deity, she just doesn't appreciate being drowned and burned every year and she lashes out. Maybe that results in some nuclear stuff, maybe it's just a sub-plot, I'm not the lead writer, so go wild.

## Enemies

*These guys are basically Hecate's minions in Greek/Roman mythology.*

* Lamia/Empusa (Greek, not Basque)
* Mormo
* Sybaris
* Lampads
